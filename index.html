        <h1>Happy Birthday, Sis! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
        <p>On this special day, I just want you to know how deeply you are loved â€” not just today, but every single day. You are more than family; you are a light in my life, a constant source of strength, grace, and kindness. Watching you grow into the incredible person you are has been one of the greatest blessings of my life. Iâ€™m so proud of your heart, your courage, and the way you chase your dreams. May this new year bring you joy that fills your soul, moments that remind you how truly amazing you are, and love that surrounds you wherever you go.
        Happy Birthday â€” you mean the world to me. ðŸ’–ðŸŽ‚âœ¨</p>
        <p>With love, your brother ðŸ’œ</p>
